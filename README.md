# Fetch Recap Task

Today, you will be using your newfound skills to make apps that request data from a server.

## Step 1 - Choosing an API

Here are some free APIs we can use.

- [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
- [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)

Each API has documentation on how to ask for data by changing the URL. Look at the documentation and pick which API you want to use. Test it with a tool like Thunder Client, Postman, etc.

Look at the response types you can get. Based on the information the API returns, plan out the functionality of your app and how you'll display the information.

## Step 2 - Plan and build

Now that you picked an API and tested it, plan and build a web app that:

- Gets data from the API using fetch
- Displays the data on the page using DOM manipulation

Remember to use computational thinking.
